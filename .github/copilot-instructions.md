- **Development**: Use standard Node.js development practices
- **Testing**: No specific testing framework established yet

## Code Patterns
- No established patterns yet - follow standard Node.js conventions
- Use ES6+ features
- Maintain clean, readable code structure

## Key Files/Directories
- `README.md`: Project documentation (currently empty)
- `.github/`: CI/CD and AI instructions
- Future: `src/`, `tests/`, `package.json`, etc.

## Communication Patterns
- No external integrations established yet
- Follow standard Node.js module patterns

## Notes
This instructions file will be updated as the project develops and patterns emerge. Currently, the project is in initialization phase with minimal codebase.
